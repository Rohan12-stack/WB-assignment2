  <pre>
  Christmas is one of the most widely celebrated festivals on Planet Earth. This day commemorates the birth anniversary of Jesus Christ and is celebrated by decorating homes, exchanging gifts and organizing family get together.

Although, Christmas is mainly associated with Christians yet non-Christian communities also take part in the celebrations enthusiastically.
<mark>One of the merriest times of the year, Christmas is observed on 25th December, every year.Christmas celebrations in the denominations
of Western Christianity have long begun on Christmas Eve, due in part to the Christian 
liturgical day starting at sunset,[5] a practice inherited from Jewish tradition[6] and based on the story of Creation in the Book of Genesis:
"And there was evening, and there was morning â€“ the first day."[7] Many churches still ring their church bells and hold prayers in the evening;
for example, the Nordic Lutheran churches.</mark>[8] Since tradition holds that Jesus was born at night (based in Luke 2:6-8), Midnight Mass is
celebrated on Christmas Eve, traditionally at midnight, in commemoration of his birth.[9] The idea of Jesus being born at night is reflected in 
the fact that Christmas Eve is referred to as Heilige Nacht (Holy Night) in German, Nochebuena (the Good Night) in Spanish and similarly in other
expressions of Christmas spirituality, such as the song "Silent Night, Holy Night".

Many other varying cultural traditions and experiences are also associated with Christmas Eve around the world, including the gathering of family 
and friends, the singing of Christmas carols, the illumination and enjoyment of Christmas lights, trees, and other decorations, the wrapping, exchange
and opening of gifts, and general preparation for Christmas Day. Legendary Christmas gift-bearing figures including Santa Claus, Father Christmas, 
Christkind, and Saint Nicholas are also often said to depart for their annual journey to deliver presents to children around the world on Christmas 
Eve, although until the Protestant introduction of Christkind in 16th-century Europe,[10] such figures were said to instead deliver presents on the 
eve of Saint Nicholas' feast day (6 December)
